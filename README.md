# Building an image from polygons using genetic algorithm

The main idea is to recreate some given image using polygons of different sizes and colors, starting from a blank image. The image is initialized with some random polygons and genetic algorithm is used to reshape and recolor these polygons, hopefully creating something close to the original image.
